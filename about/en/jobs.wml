About the company:<br>
 The Tor Project is a US 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to research,
 development, and education about online anonymity and privacy. The Tor
 network's 6000 volunteer relays carry 48 Gbps for several
 million daily users, including ordinary citizens who want protection
 from identity theft and prying corporations, corporations who want
 to look at a competitor's website in private, people around the world
 whose Internet connections are censored, and even governments and law
 enforcement. Tor has a staff of 30 paid developers, researchers, and
 advocates, plus many dozen volunteers who help out on a daily basis. Tor
 is funded in part by government research and development grants, and
 in part by individual and corporate donations.
