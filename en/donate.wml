<h3><a class="anchor" href="#relay">Run a relay</a></h3>
<p>The easiest, most effective way to support online privacy and
anonymity around the world is to run a relay.  You join a set of
committed people in the world already running a relay.  The easiest way to speed up
Tor is to add more relays to the network.  Running a relay is as easy as
<a href="<page docs/tor-doc-relay>">clicking a button</a>.  Join the
network.  Support your online anonymity and privacy!</p>

<a id="services"></a>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#services">Donate Services</a></h3>
<p>The Tor Project is always looking for services relating to technical
needs, like bandwidth, colocation, hosted services, legal
representation, or consulting.  By donating services, you join our <a
href="<page sponsors>">many sponsors</a> in providing online privacy
and anonymity.  We're currently looking for scalable hosting services for
reporting needs from large data sets and reliable high-bandwidth hosting.
We may have hardware we can provide you for your service donation.</p>
<p>Can you write code?  We're always looking for smart, motivated
coders to either port Tor to new or old operating systems, or solve
difficult online anonymity problems.  Take a look at <a href="<page
volunteer>#Coding">our coding projects</a>.</p>
<p>Are you a creative person?  Do you have a fantastic idea for a
campaign?  Are you someone who can come up with awesome artwork?  We're
always looking for new ways to promote Tor and get the word out that
everyone needs their privacy and anonymity online.</p>
<p>Is your legal firm willing to defend Tor and its volunteers?  Are you
waiting for an interesting case to defend online privacy and
anonymity?</p>
<p>If any of the service ideas struck a nerve, contact us at donations@torproject.org for more details.</p>  

<div class="underline"></div>
<a id="hardware"></a>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#hardware">Donate Hardware</a></h3>
<p>We're generally looking for donated hardware and support services that could be used to provide the infrastructure that supports Tor's operations, including website mirrors, database servers, build systems and legacy hardware for supporting packages on older Operating Systems; such as OS X 10.2, OS X 10.3, Windows XP, Windows 7, IRIX, Redhat, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, etc.  A number of service providers have an abundance of bandwidth capacity, but need hardware in order donate it to us. </p>
<p>By donating hardware, you're joining our <a href="<page sponsors>">many sponsors</a> in providing online privacy and anonymity.  If you want Tor to work on your architecture or hardware, a fine way to do this is to donate the hardware and operating system to us.  Contact us at donations@torproject.org for more details.</p>

<a id="time"></a>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#time">Donate Time</a></h3>
