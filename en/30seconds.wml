<h2>Why You Need Tor</h2>
<hr />

<p>The vast majority of Internet traffic passes along public routes, making it
relatively easy for prying eyes to view your comings and goings -- and even
link some important financial or personal information to you!</p>

<p>Snoopers can get your information almost anywhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Internet service provider</li>
<li>Your favorite website or online store</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are commonly called traffic analysis and corporations,
marketing organizations, governments, and other parties are becoming
increasingly sophisticated at it.</p>

<p>Traffic Analysis enables: </p>
<ul>
<li>Politically rigid governments to compile lists of citizens reading outlawed
journals</li>
<li>Thieves, spammers, and phishers to launch progressively sophisticated and
personalized attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>For some people, this electronic spying is a nuisance that can affect their
pocketbook; for others, it jeopardizes their personal security.</p>

<p>Since 2001, the Tor Project has been developing free and
 open-source software that helps provide anonymity for Internet users. It works
by allowing users
to travel the web on a circuitous route on a set of servers positioned
around the world. When you use Tor, your route on the Internet is indirect,
so snoops have a difficult time following your path and seizing vital
information. Tor also has special functionality, called hidden services,
that allows users to run websites without revealing their location.</p>

<p>Tor is compatible with different operating systems, such as Microsoft
Windows, Apple Mac, and various versions of Linux. Tor works with most
programs that connect your computer to the Internet.</p>

<p>Tor is used by hundreds of thousands of people to protect their activities
online:</p>
<ul>
<li>Journalists who need to protect their sources</li>
<li>Human rights workers</li>
<li>Dissidents in politically rigid countries</li>
<li>Whistle blowers who fear retribution</li>
<li>Law enforcement officers on Internet sting operations</li>
<li>People wanting to post socially sensitive information in chat
rooms, like rape or abuse survivors and those with stigmatized illnesses.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Tor Network also provides protection for people looking for another
layer of privacy from the millions of websites bent on collecting private
information and tracking their moves online.</p>

<h2>Why Tor Needs You</h2>
