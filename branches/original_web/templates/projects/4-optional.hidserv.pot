"Tor Hidden Services allow users to set up anonymous information services, "
"like websites, that can only be accessed through the Tor network and are "
"protected against identification of the host that runs the services.  The "
"most critical limitations of Tor Hidden Services are the time it takes until "
"a Hidden Service is registered in the network and the latency of contact "
"establishment when accessed by a user.  Due to design issues in the original "
"Tor protocol, the connection to a new Hidden Service can take several "
"minutes, which leads most users to give up before the connection has been "
"established.  Using Tor Hidden Services for direct interactive user-to-user "
"communication (e.g. messaging) is nearly impossible due to the high latency "
"of Hidden Service circuit setup."

"This project aims at speeding up Tor Hidden Services by improving the way "
"Tor circuits are set up between the user and the Hidden Service as well as "
"the way a Hidden Service is registered in the Tor network.  In a first step "
"precise diagnostics of the behavior of the Hidden Services in lab setups and "
"real world situations will be conducted to find the root causes of the bad "
"timing effects.  Based on these diagnostics, optimization strategies will be "
"designed and verified for unwanted implications for the security and "
"anonymity of the Tor network.  The most promising optimizations will then be "
"implemented to achieve a notable improvement for the users. Precise success "
"metrics will be developed in the diagnostics phase, after it becomes clear "
"where the time is lost and what improvements are realistic.  The ultimate "
"goal is to have the Hidden Services protocol change production ready and "
"propagated to the Tor users within a timeframe of less than 12 months."

"Measurements were conducted for two days in the time of November 6th to 8th. "
"Unfortunately, the Tor network suffered a serious problem in this time: An "
"expired directory authority certificate produced huge amounts of traffic "
"within the Tor network which <a href=\"http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-"

"performance is still worse than in June 2008 when the first hidden service "
"measurements have been performed. This becomes visible when comparing "
"requests to the Tor directories which have not been affected by the "
"performance improvements and which exhibit significantly worse performance "
"than before. The effects of performance improvements are visible, but "
"absolute values are not comparable at this time. New measurements will be "
"conducted in December in the hope that the effects of this problem have "

"November; the effect was that Tor processes running hidden services would "

"a <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/~karsten/hidserv/prelimreport-2008-12-15.pdf"

"and of the performance improvements added in November. In contrast to this, "
"the results for establishing a connection to a hidden service are less "
"promising. While the improvements added in November seem to have a positive "
"effect on performance, some substeps exhibit significantly worse "
"performance. One example is fetching hidden service descriptors in order to "
"contact a hidden service. A possible explanation is that the sudden increase "
"in the number of hidden service directory nodes in September has had a "
"negative effect on performance. Part of the work in the final 31 days will "
"be to evaluate these data in more detail and make a final conclusion on the "
