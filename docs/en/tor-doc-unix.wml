<h2><a class="anchor" href="#installing">Step One: Download and Install Tor</a></h2>
<br />

<p>
The latest release of Tor can be found on the <a
href="<page download-unix>">download</a> page. We have packages for Debian,
Red Hat, Gentoo, *BSD, etc there too. If you're
using Ubuntu, don't use the default packages: use <a
href="<page docs/debian>#ubuntu">our deb repository</a> instead.
</p>

<p>If you're building from source, first install <a
href="http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/">libevent</a>, and
make sure you have openssl and zlib (including the -devel packages if
applicable). Then run:<br />
<tt>tar xzf tor-<version-stable>.tar.gz; cd tor-<version-stable><br />
./configure &amp;&amp; make</tt><br />
Now you can run tor as <tt>src/or/tor</tt>, or you can run <tt>make install</tt>
(as root if necessary) to install it into /usr/local/, and then you can
start it just by running <tt>tor</tt>.
</p>

<p>Tor comes configured as a client by default. It uses a built-in
default configuration file, and most people won't need to change any of
the settings. Tor is now installed.

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#polipo">Step Two: Install Polipo for Web Browsing</a></h2>
<br />

<p>After installing Tor, you need to configure your applications to use it.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to set up web browsing. Start by installing <a
href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/">Polipo</a> from
your favorite repository. Polipo is a caching web proxy that does http
pipelining well, so it's well-suited for Tor's latencies. Make sure
to get at least Polipo 1.0.4, since earlier versions lack the SOCKS support
required to use Polipo with Tor.
</p>

<p>Once you've installed Polipo (either from package or from
source), <b>you will need to configure Polipo to use Tor</b>. Grab our <a
href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/config/polipo.conf">Polipo
configuration for Tor</a> and put it in place of your current polipo
config file (e.g. /etc/polipo/config or ~/.polipo).
You'll need to restart Polipo for the changes to take effect. For
example:<br />
<tt>/etc/init.d/polipo restart</tt>
</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can instead use Privoxy with <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/PrivoxyConfig">this
sample Privoxy configuration</a>. But since the config files both use
port 8118, you shouldn't run both Polipo and Privoxy at the same time.</p>

<hr />
<a id="using"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#using">Step Three: Configure your applications to use Tor</a></h2>
<br />

<p>After installing Tor and Polipo, you need to configure your
applications to use them. The first step is to set up web browsing.</p>

<p>You should use Tor with Firefox and Torbutton, for best safety.
Simply install the <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2275/">Torbutton
plugin</a>, restart your Firefox, and you're all set:
</p>

<img alt="Torbutton plugin for Firefox"
src="../img/screenshot-torbutton.png"
border="1">

<br />

<p>
If you plan to run Firefox on a different computer than Tor, see the <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SocksListenAddress">
FAQ
entry for running Tor on a different computer</a>.
</p>

<p>To Torify other applications that support HTTP proxies, just
point them at Polipo (that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS
directly (for instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), you can point
your application directly at Tor (localhost port 9050), but see <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">this
FAQ entry</a> for why this may be dangerous. For applications
that support neither SOCKS nor HTTP, take a look at <a
href="http://tsocks.sourceforge.net/">tsocks</a> or <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO#socat">socat</a>.
</p>

<a href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO">Torify
HOWTO</a>.

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#verify">Step Four: Make sure it's working</a></h2>
<br />

<p>
Next, you should try using your browser with Tor and make
sure that your IP address is being anonymized. Click on
<a href="https://check.torproject.org/">the
Tor detector</a>
and see whether it thinks you're using Tor or not.
#<a href="http://ipchicken.com/">this site</a>
#to see what IP address it thinks you're using.
(If that site is down, see <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#IsMyConnectionPrivate">this
FAQ entry</a> for more suggestions on how to test your Tor.)
</p>

<p>If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's
ability to connect to itself (this includes something like SELinux on
Fedora Core 4), be sure to allow connections from
your local applications to Polipo (local port 8118) and Tor (local port
9050). If
your firewall blocks outgoing connections, punch a hole so
it can connect to at least TCP ports 80 and 443, and then see <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FirewalledClient">this
FAQ entry</a>.  If your SELinux config is not allowing tor or privoxy to
run correctly, create a file named booleans.local in the directory
/etc/selinux/targeted.  Edit this file in your favorite text editor and
insert "allow_ypbind=1".  Restart your machine for this change to take
effect.
</p>

<p>If it's still not working, look at <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ItDoesntWork">this
FAQ entry</a> for hints.</p>

<a id="relay"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#relay">Step Five: Configure it as a relay</a></h2>
<br />

<p>The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more
people who run relays, the faster the Tor network will be. If you have
at least 20 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor by configuring your
Tor to be a relay too. We have many features that make Tor relays easy
and convenient, including rate limiting for bandwidth, exit policies so
you can limit your exposure to abuse complaints, and support for dynamic
IP addresses.</p>

<p>Having relays in many different places on the Internet is what
makes Tor users secure. <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#RelayAnonymity">You
may also get stronger anonymity yourself</a>,
since remote sites can't know whether connections originated at your
computer or were relayed from others.</p>

guide.</p>
