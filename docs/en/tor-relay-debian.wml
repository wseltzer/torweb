    <h1>Configuring a Tor relay on Debian/Ubuntu</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
    The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more
    people who run relays, the faster the Tor network will be. If you have
    at least 50 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor by configuring your
    Tor to be a relay too.
    </p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#install">Step One: Download and Install Tor</a></h2>
    <br>

    <p>If you're on Debian, you can just "apt-get install tor".</p>

    <p><b>Do not use the packages in Ubuntu's universe.</b> If you're
    on Ubuntu or if you want to track newer Tor packages, follow the
    <a href="<page docs/debian>#ubuntu">Tor on Ubuntu or Debian</a>
    instructions to use our repository.
    </p>

    <p>For other Unix/Linux uesrs, you can download Tor from one of our
    <a href="<page download/download-unix>">repositories</a>.</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#setup">Step Two: Set it up as a relay</a></h2>

    <p>
    1. Make sure your clock, date, and timezone are set correctly. Install
    the ntp or openntpd (or similar) package to keep it that way.
    </p>

    <p>
    2. Edit the bottom part of <a href="<page
    docs/faq>#torrc">/etc/tor/torrc</a>. Define an ORPort. <b>Note
    that public relays default to being <a href="<page
    docs/faq>#ExitPolicies">exit relays</a></b> &mdash; either change your
    ExitPolicy line or read our <a
href="<wiki>/doc/TorExitGuidelines">guidelines
    for exit relay operators</a>. Be sure to set your ContactInfo line
    so we can contact you if you need to upgrade or something goes wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
    3. If you are using a firewall, open a hole in your firewall
    so incoming connections can reach the ports you configured
    (ORPort, plus DirPort if you enabled it). If you have a
    hardware firewall (Linksys box, cablemodem, etc) you might like <a
    href="http://portforward.com/">portforward.com</a>. Also, make sure you
    allow all <em>outgoing</em> connections too, so your relay can reach the
    other Tor relays.
    </p>

    <p>
    4. Restart your relay: "service tor reload" (as root).
    </p>

    <a id="check"></a>
    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#check">Step Three: Make sure it is working</a></h2>
    <br>

    <p>Once your relay connects to the network, it will
    try to determine whether the ports you configured are reachable from
    the outside. This step is usually fast, but it may take a few minutes.
    Look for a <a href="<page docs/faq>#Logs">log entry</a> in your
    /var/log/tor/log like
    <tt>Self-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent.</tt>
    If you don't see this message, it means that your relay is not reachable
    from the outside &mdash; you should re-check your firewalls, check that it's
    testing the IP and port you think it should be testing, etc.
    </p>

    <p>When it decides that it's reachable, it will upload a "server
    descriptor" to the directory authorities, to let clients know
    what address, ports, keys, etc your relay is using. After a few
    hours (to give it enough time to propagate), you can query
    <a href="https://atlas.torproject.org/">Atlas</a> or
    <a href="https://globe.torproject.org/">Globe</a> to see whether your
    relay has successfully registered in the network.</p>

    <br>

    <p>
    5. Read
    <a href="<wiki>doc/OperationalSecurity">about operational security</a>
    to get ideas how you can increase the security of your computer.
    </p>

    <p>
    6. Decide about rate limiting. Cable modem, DSL, and other users
    who have asymmetric bandwidth (e.g. more down than up) should
    rate limit to their slower bandwidth, to avoid congestion. See the <a
    href="<wikifaq>#LimitBandwidth">rate
    limiting FAQ entry</a> for details.
    </p>

    <p>
    7. If your computer isn't running a webserver, please consider
    changing your ORPort to 443 and/or your DirPort to 80. Many Tor users
    are stuck behind firewalls that only let them browse the web, and
    this change will let them reach your Tor relay. If you are already
    using ports 80 and 443, other useful ports are 22, 110, and 143.
    </p>

    <p>
    8. Consider backing up your Tor relay's private key
    ("/var/lib/tor/keys/secret_id_key"). You'll need this identity key to
    <a href="<wikifaq>#UpgradeRelay">move or restore your Tor relay</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    9. If you run an exit relay (great!), don't miss out on our <a href="<wiki>doc/TorExitGuidelines">Exit Guidelines</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    10. Subscribe to the <a
    href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-announce">tor-announce</a>
    mailing list. It is very low volume, and it will keep you informed
    of new stable releases. You might also consider subscribing to <a
    href="<page docs/documentation>#MailingLists">the higher-volume Tor lists</a>
    too (especially tor-relays).
    </p>

    <p>
    11. <a href="https://weather.torproject.org/">Tor Weather</a> provides
    an email notification service to any users who want to monitor the
    status of a Tor node. Upon subscribing, you can specify what types of
    alerts you would like to receive. The main purpose of Tor Weather is
    to notify node operators via email if their node is down for longer
    than a specified period, but other notification types are available.
    </p>

    <p>
    12. If you want to run more than one relay that's great, but please set <a
    href="<page docs/faq>#MultipleRelays">the
    MyFamily option</a> in all your relays' configuration files.
    </p>

    <p>
    13. You might like to use the <a
    href="https://www.atagar.com/arm/">arm</a> relay monitor to watch
    your relay's activities from the command line. First, "sudo apt-get
    install tor-arm". Second, as the user that will be running arm, run
    "sudo adduser $USER debian-tor" to add your user to the debian-tor
    group so it can reach Tor's controlsocket. Then log out and log back
    in (so your user is actually in the group), and run "arm".
