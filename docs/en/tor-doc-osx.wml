    <h1>Running Tor on Mac OS X</h1>
    <br>

    <h2>These are advanced installation instructions for running
    Tor in a command line. The recommended way to use Tor is to simply download the
    <a href="<page projects/torbrowser>">Tor Browser</a> and you
    are done.
    </h2>

    <p>Even though the Tor Browser comes with a regular Tor, it will only run
    as long as you keep the Tor Browser open. The following instructions will
    set up Tor without graphical interface or a browser. Many people prefer
    this over TBB when they host hidden services or relay traffic for other Tor
    users.  <hr>

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#installing">Step One: Install Macports</a></h2>
    <br>

    <p>
    Macports is a package manager for Mac OS X which provides a Tor package,
    along a lot of other stuff. Follow the instructions on <a
    href="https://www.macports.org/install.php">its Website</a> to install.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Step Two: Install Tor</a></h2>
    <br>

    <p>In a Terminal window, run:</p>

    <pre>sudo port install tor</pre>

    <p>You will find a sample Tor configuration file at
    <tt>/opt/local/etc/tor/torrc.sample</tt>. Remove the .sample extension to
    make it effective.</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#using">Step Three: Configure your application to use Tor</a></h2>

    <p>
    To use SOCKS directly (for instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), you can
    point your application directly at Tor (localhost port 9050), but see <a
    href="<wikifaq>#SOCKSAndDNS">this FAQ entry</a> for why this may be
    dangerous. For applications that support neither SOCKS nor HTTP, take a
    look at <a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a>.</p>

    <p>For information on how to Torify other applications, check out the
    <a href="<wiki>doc/TorifyHOWTO">Torify HOWTO</a>.
    </p>

    <p>If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's ability to
    connect to itself, be sure to allow connections from your local
    applications to local port 9050. If your firewall blocks outgoing
    connections, punch a hole so it can connect to at least TCP ports 80 and
    443, and then see <a href="<wikifaq>#FirewalledClient">this FAQ entry</a>.
    </p>

    <p>If it's still not working, look at <a
    href="<page docs/faq>#DoesntWork">this FAQ entry</a> for hints.</p>

    <p>
    Once it's working, learn more about <a href="<page
    download/download>#Warning">what Tor does and does not offer</a>.

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#relay">Configure Tor as a relay</a></h2>
    <br>

    <p>The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. If you
    want to help <strong>make the Tor network faster</strong>, please
    consider <a href="<page docs/tor-doc-relay>">running a relay</a>.</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#uninstall">How To Uninstall Tor</a></h2>
    <br>

    <p>Change your application proxy settings back to their original
    values.  If you just want to stop using Tor, you can end at this
    point.</p>

    <p>If you want to completely remove Tor, type into a Terminal window:</p>

    <pre>sudo port uninstall tor</pre>
