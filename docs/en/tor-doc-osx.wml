<h2><a class="anchor" href="#installing">Step One: Download and Install Tor</a></h2>
<br />

<p>
The install for Macintosh OS X bundles
<a href="<page index>">Tor</a>,
<a href="<page vidalia/index>">Vidalia</a> (a graphical interface for Tor),
<a href="<page torbutton/index>">Torbutton</a>,
and <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/">Polipo</a> (a web proxy)
into one package, with the four applications pre-configured to work
together.
Download either the <a href="../<package-osx-bundle-stable>">stable</a>
or the <a href="../<package-osx-bundle-alpha>">experimental</a> version
of the OS X bundle, or look for more options on the <a href="<page
download>">download page</a>.
</p>

<p>It's easy to install the bundle; simply drag and drop the Vidalia
onion icon to the Applications folder.</p>

<p>When the installer is finished, you can start Vidalia by selecting its icon
from your Applications folder. A dark onion with a red X in your dock means
Tor is not currently running. You can start Tor by selecting Start from the
"Tor" menu at the top of your screen.
</p>

<p>When Tor is running, Vidalia's dock icon will look like the following:
</p>

<p><img alt="vidalia running tor"
src="../img/screenshot-osx-vidalia.png"
border="1"/></p>

<p>Polipo is installed as part of the Tor bundle package
installer. Once it is installed, it will start automatically when your
computer is restarted.
You do not need to configure Polipo to use Tor &mdash; a custom Polipo 
configuration for Tor has been installed as part of the installer package.

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#using">Step Two: Configure your applications to use Tor</a></h2>
<br />

<p>After installing Tor and Privoxy, you need to configure your
applications to use them. The first step is to set up web browsing.</p>

<p>You should use Tor with Firefox and Torbutton, for best safety.
Torbutton was installed for you.  Click on the red "Tor Disabled" toggle button to
turn Tor on, and you're all set: </p>

<p><img alt="Torbutton plugin for Firefox"
src="../img/screenshot-torbutton.png"
border="1"/></p>

<p>
If you plan to run Firefox on a different computer than Tor, see the <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SocksListenAddress">FAQ
entry for running Tor on a different computer</a>.
</p>

<p>To Torify other applications that support HTTP proxies, just
point them at Privoxy (that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS
directly (for instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), you can point
your application directly at Tor (localhost port 9050), but see <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">this
FAQ entry</a> for why this may be dangerous. For applications
that support neither SOCKS nor HTTP, take a look at <a
href="http://www.taiyo.co.jp/~gotoh/ssh/connect.html">connect</a> or
<a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a>.</p>

<p>For information on how to Torify other applications, check out the
<a href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO">Torify
HOWTO</a>.

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#verify">Step Three: Make sure it's working</a></h2>
<br />

<p>
Next, you should try using your browser with Tor and make
sure that your IP address is being anonymized. Click on
<a href="https://check.torproject.org/">the
Tor detector</a>
and see whether it thinks you're using Tor or not.
(If that site is down, see <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#IsMyConnectionPrivate">this
FAQ entry</a> for more suggestions on how to test your Tor.)
</p>

<p>If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's
ability to connect to itself, be sure to allow connections from
your local applications to local port 8118 and port 9050. If
your firewall blocks outgoing connections, punch a hole so
it can connect to at least TCP ports 80 and 443, and then see <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FirewalledClient">this
FAQ entry</a>.
</p>

<p>If it's still not working, look at <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ItDoesntWork">this
FAQ entry</a> for hints.</p>

Once it's working, learn more about

<a id="relay"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#relay">Step Four: Configure it as a relay</a></h2>
<br />

<p>The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more
people who run relays, the faster the Tor network will be. If you have
at least 20 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor by configuring your
Tor to be a relay too. We have many features that make Tor relays easy
and convenient, including rate limiting for bandwidth, exit policies so
you can limit your exposure to abuse complaints, and support for dynamic
IP addresses.</p>

<p>Having relays in many different places on the Internet is what
makes Tor users secure. <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#RelayAnonymity">You
may also get stronger anonymity yourself</a>,
since remote sites can't know whether connections originated at your
computer or were relayed from others.</p>

<p>Read more at our <a href="<page docs/tor-doc-relay>">Configuring a relay</a>
guide.</p>

<hr />
<a id="uninstall"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#uninstall">How To Uninstall Tor and Privoxy</a></h2>
<br />

<p>Tor has a command line or Terminal-based uninstaller.  If you want to remove Tor on OSX, here's how:</p>

<p>Change your application proxy settings back to their original values.
   If you just want to stop using Tor, you can end at this point.</p>

<p>If you want to completely remove Tor, and your account has Admin
Privileges, then proceed as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drag /Applications/Vidalia to the Trash.</li>
<li>Remove /Library/Torbutton from your system.</li>
<li>In your home directory, go to Library, remove the Vidalia
directory</li>
</ol>

<p>Tor, Vidalia, and Polipo are now completely removed from your system.</p>

<p>If you're familiar with the command line or Terminal, you can
manually remove the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>/Applications/Vidalia.app/</li>
<li>/Library/Torbutton/</li>
<li>~/Library/Vidalia</li>
<li>~/.tor</li>
</ul>
