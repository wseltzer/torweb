"The Tor anonymity system is currently only usable by internet users who have "
"high-bandwidth connections. Upon the start of the Tor client, a large file "
"with all Tor server descriptions is being downloaded. This file is the so-"
"called Tor Directory and enables the client to choose from the available mix-"
"servers in the Tor network. The download of the full Tor Directory is "
"required by the current Tor protocol. This directory file is too large for "
"users on modem lines or on mobile data networks like GPRS as the initial "
"download that is triggered every time an user logs in takes 10 to 30 minutes "
"over a slow line. As a result, Tor is not usable by modem and mobile users. "
"One of the major goals of the Tor project is to provide secure anonymous "
"internet access to users in dictatorships and repressive states. These "
"locations often have very slow internet connections, either by modem or due "
"to low-bandwidth links to the outside world. By enabling these users to use "
"the Tor network, significant progress can be made towards free communication "
"and information in these countries."

"To make Tor usable also for users on low-bandwidth connections, an evolution "
"of the Tor protocol is needed to reduce the initial download size. This new "
"Tor protocol version should change the way a client receives the information "
"for its Tor circuit setup in a way, that the initial download can be "
"performed over a 14.4 kbps modem line in about three minutes. The work to be "
"conducted under the proposal has the ultimate goal of getting the protocol "
"change production ready and propagated to the Tor users within a timeframe "
"of less then 12 months. The resulting software will be published under the 3-"
"Clause BSD license, as all of the Tor code. All deliverables will be fully "
"public."

"<b>Deliverable A:</b> Design and evaluation of the protocol change<br /> "
"<small><em>This deliverable covers the detailed design and simulation-based "
"evaluation of the necessary changes and design modifications to the current "
"Tor protocol.  The changes in protocol will be relatively substantial, so it "
"requires a careful evaluation of possible repercussions for the security and "
"anonymity of the Tor network. A two-month period is planned for this design "
"and evaluation phase, which concludes with an extensive peer review. Part of "
"Deliverable A will be a goal definition for performance for the "
"implementation phase. The design goal is to shrink the Tor Directory size "
"that needs to be downloaded to about 300 Kilobytes, which would enable an "
"user on a 14.4 kbps line to download it in roughly three minutes. There may "
"be deviations from this design goal if required to maintain anonymity and "
"security, but this is the figure to aim for.  </em></small>"
